## Fooducate
Many foods, such as protein bars or frozen dinners, masquerade as healthy options, even though they're actually anything but. Fooducate makes it easy to determine whether those quinoa crackers are actually healthier than a bag of chips. Its database of more than 250,000 items allows you to scan any food UPC label using your smartphone’s camera. It'll then give the product a letter grade, along with an explanation for why it is or isn’t healthy. The app will even provide a list of healthier options that are similar to the product you’re eyeing.

# Done
Struggling to kick that late night snacking? Just can’t seem to wake up for those early am workouts? Letting go of bad habits is hard, and adopting healthy ones can seem brutal. Done aims to make both easier. Set goals, track your activity and progress, and set reminders to stay motivated throughout the day.
- [Segumiento de Habitos]

## YouAte
Think of this app as a mashup of traditional food diaries, like MyFitnessPal, and instagram. Instead of weighing and logging food from the database, users upload photos of meals. YouAte stresses mindful eating, so you can record emotions to determine if stress led you to eating those afternoon donuts.

## KetoDiet
The KetoDiet app is a great resource for those following the high-fat diet. You’ll find recipes; food and body weight tracking; and a keto starter guide. There’s even a calculator to determine how much fat, protein, and carbs you should eat to stay in ketosis, or fat burning mode.

# See How You Eat
Another photo-based food diary, this app lets you post photos of meals and snacks to help you monitor portion sizes, and prevent excess snacking and overeating. Opt for the premium version and get feedback from a nutrition coach.
